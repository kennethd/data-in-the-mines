# data in the mines

data-in-the-mines provides a framework for periodically creating
reports from your data sources, with the primary goal of automating data
discovery reports and providing a window onto the data in the mines.

Included is an example app that illustrates how data-in-the-mines integrates
with any Flask web app, and provides a web interface to the example reports.
